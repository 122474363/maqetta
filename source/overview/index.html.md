title: Maqetta Overview
---

Maqetta is an open source technology initiative at  Dojo Foundation that provides WYSIWYG visual authoring of HTML5 user interfaces for HTML5 (desktop and mobile). The Maqetta application itself is authored in HTML, and therefore runs in the browser without requiring additional plugins or downloads. Maqetta allows user interface designers (sometimes known as User Experience Designers - UXD) to perform drag/drop assembly of *live UI mockups*.

The following articles explore various aspects of the Maqetta open source initiative:
