title: Review and Commenting
---

Maqetta provides web-based review and commenting.

* **Reviewing a real application, versus a picture of the application** - With Maqetta, authors can construct live UI mockups that are actual working HTML pages, which means that reviewers can give feedback on a mockup that is a working prototype of a final application.
* **New Review... command on main menu** - Authors initiate a Review and Commenting session through the **New Review...** command, found on the **New** dropdown menu on the main toolbar. This command will present a wizard which allows the author to choose which files should be published as part of the review and which colleagues (identified by email address) should participate in the review session. Upon clicking "Publish", Maqetta sends emails to the invitees. The emails contain hyperlinks that take the reviewers to Maqetta's review and commenting user interfaces.
* **Reviewers: blog-style text comments and graphical annotations** - Reviewers can enter either textual comments using a blog-style user interface (including replies to existing comments) and/or on-screen graphical annotations (rectangles, ovals, arrows and text). Reviewers can see the comments and annotations from other reviewers. Each reviewer's comments are highlighted using a different color.
* **States palette: comment on particular application states** - The desktop Review and Commenting user interface shows a Scenes palette that lists the interactive states used by the HTML page. This allows the reviewer to step through the various application states one-by-one and provide feedback on the UI used for each of the states.
* **Mobile review/commenting - view-specific comments** - The mobile Review and Commenting user interface shows a Scenes palette that lists the different mobile views used by the HTML page. This allows the reviewer to step through the various application states one-by-one and provide feedback on the UI used for each of the mobile views.
