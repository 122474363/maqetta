We have now posted Release 9 of the Maqetta application at http://maqetta.org. 

If you run the Maqetta application at http://maqetta.org, you be running the new release. 

If you have been using a downloaded version of Maqetta 8, then we recommend that you pull down the new Release 9 download from http://maqetta.org/downloads/ (usually http://www.maqetta.org/downloads/maqetta-release-9.zip), and then copy your users/ folder from your Release 8 installation into your Release 9 installation.

We are not aware of any migration issues with user files.

Major changes include several new tutorials, LDAP support, WAR/Tomcat support, and three new icons on Scenes palette for more efficient development using application states. For more information about the new release, please refer to the release notes:
