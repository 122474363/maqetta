We have now posted **Release 8** of the Maqetta application at http://maqetta.org. 

If you run the Maqetta application at http://maqetta.org, you be running the new release. 

If you are using a downloaded version of Maqetta 7, then we recommend that you pull down the new Release 8 download from http://maqetta.org/downloads/, and then copy your users/ folder from your Release 7 installation into your Release 8 installation.

We are not aware of any migration issues with user files.

From  a user perspective, the primary new feature is the redesign of the  "Palette" (the list of widgets at top/left of the user interface for the  visual page editor). For more information about the Palette changes,  and other changes in this release, please refer to the release notes:

We also changed one of the server settings at Maqetta.org, which will  improve performance, but at this point, we aren't sure how significant  the performance improvements will be.
