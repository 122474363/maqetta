<h1>Exporting to Developer Tools Tutorial</h1>

<a name="about_this_tutorial"><h2>About this tutorial</h2></a>

<p>Using Maqetta, the user create web application prototypes which are subsequently handed off to
	developers, who transform the prototype incrementally into a production application.</p>
<p>	This tutorial introduces the features in Maqetta that help with the 
	designer-to-developer hand-off. The tutorial starts by introducing some important
	concepts. The tutorial then highlights the product's export-as-ZIP and workspace management features,
	including the ability to create Eclipse-compatible projects.</p>

<a name="exploring_workspace_html_files"><h2>Exploring the Maqetta workspace</h2></a>

<p>When you launch Maqetta for the first time, Maqetta creates a default workspace
and a default project ("project1"). The picture below
shows the default workspace:
</p>

<p><a href="img/Files_palette_initial.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/Files_palette_initial.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;" width="200" /></a></p>

<p>Make the following adjustments to the Files palette</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the horizontal divider that is just above the Files palette:
	<p><a href="img/Files_palette_divider.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/Files_palette_divider.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;" width="200" /></a></p>
	 upwards
	to increase the size of the Files palette until it is about 2/3 the height
	of the Maqetta browser window. (As a result, this will take size away from the 
	Widgets and Review palettes.)
</li>
<li>Look at the <code>lib</code> entry in the Files palette. 
	If it is closed (i.e., it has a "+" icon on the left size),
	then click on the "+' to open <code>lib</code> to show its children.</li>
<li>Under <code>lib</code>, you should see a child entry for <code>dojo</code>.
	Look at the <code>dojo</code> entry in the Files palette. 
	If it is closed (i.e., it has a "+" icon on the left size),
	then click on the "+' to open <code>dojo</code> to show its children.</li>
<li>Look at the <code>themes</code> entry in the Files palette. 
	If it is closed (i.e., it has a "+" icon on the left size),
	then click on the "+' to open <code>themes</code> to show its children</li>
</ul>

<p>The Files palette should now look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="img/Files_palette_libs_themes.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/Files_palette_libs_themes.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;" width="200" /></a></p>

<p>Some things to note:</p> 
<ul>
<li>In Maqetta's default workspace, JavaScript libraries are placed into the <code>libs/</code> folder.
	The picture above shows two libraries, <code>dojo/</code> and <code>html/</code>.
	<ul>
		<li>The <code>dojo/</code> folder contains a <em>read-only</em> version of the 
			<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo toolkit</a>.
			Inside the outer <code>dojo/</code> are the three main folders that make up a Dojo release,
			<code>dijit</code> (Dojo's desktop widget library),
			<code>dojo</code> (Dojo's core functions) and
			<code>dojox</code> (an extensive library of Dojo extensions).
			<div class="note">
				<div>Maqetta includes a <em>release</em> distribution of Dojo in your workspace.</div>
				<div>A <em>release</em> distribution contains
				compressed versions of JavaScript and CSS files. Both release and full source
				distributions for the Dojo toolkit can be found at 
				<a href="http://download.dojotoolkit.org/">http://download.dojotoolkit.org/</a>.
				Source distributions contain uncompressed versions of JavaScript and CSS
				files and include various other files useful to developers, such as build utilities,
				demos, test files and documentation.
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>At <a href="http://maqetta.org">Maqetta.org</a>, you will also see
			<code>jQuery/</code> and <code>YUI</code> subfolders within the <code>libs/</code> folder.
			These subfolders are present because the version of the application
			posted at <a href="http://maqetta.org">Maqetta.org</a> 
			includes some
			widgets from the <code>jQuery</code> and <code>YUI</code> libraries.
			<div class="note">
				<div>Maqetta has a general architecture that allows arbitrary JavaScript toolkits
					and arbitrary widget libraries to plug in. With the current release,
					not all library extensibility points are completed, so at this time adding
					additional libraries requires some source code changes to the
					Maqetta open source.</div>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>The <code>themes/</code> folder (Dojo themes) contains the CSS style themes used by your
			applications. If you application uses any Dojo widgets, your application
			probably requires the <code>themes/</code> folder in order to work properly
			outside of Maqetta.
		</li>
		<li>The <code>html/</code> folder is likely to be removed from future releases and can be ignored
			for now.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>All CSS themes used by Maqetta are in the <code>themes/</code> folder. Maqetta includes
	two themes by default in each workspace, both of which are <em>read-only</em>:
	<ul>
		<li>The <code>claro/</code> theme is the default theme used by the Dijit widget library in the Dojo toolkit.
		</li>
		<li>The <code>sketch/</code> theme restyles Dijit widgets to have a pseudo-hand-drawn look that is
			useful in early wireframing scenarios when designers prefer visually neutral rendition
			of UI so that reviewers will focus on the flow of the UI rather than focus on
			visual aspects such as fonts and colors. 
		</li>
		<li>Any custom themes created with the "New theme..." command (found on the New menu at the top of the application)
			will be added to the <code>themes/</code> folder. For example, if you create a new theme called "mytheme1":
			then the Files palette would show a <code>mytheme1</code> subfolder under <code>themes/</code>:
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Maqetta automatically includes a reference to an application CSS file (i.e., <code>app.css</code>) with each new HTML
	file created by a New HTML File command.</p>
	<p>You can insert application-specific CSS style rules in the <code>app.css</code> file
	either by using some of the advanced features in the Properties palette
	or by double-clicking on <code>app.css</code> in the Files palette
	to bring up the source editor, where you can type CSS style rules by hand.
	(See <a href="index.html#peAppCss">Creating Style Rules with app.css</a>.)</p>
	<p>At the top of the default <code>app.css</code> file, you will find a large CSS comment block 
	that explains the purpose of the file and some hints about how to use it:</p>
	<blockquote><strong>app.css default contents</strong>
	<pre class="code_block_tight_spacing">
/*
 * This file is provided for application-specific style rules.
 *
 * By default, Maqetta includes this CSS file within HTML pages
 * authored in Maqetta.
 *
 * This file is typically used to override style rules found in
 * theme CSS files. For example, suppose the theme CSS file has:
 *
 * .claro .dijitButton .dijitButtonNode {
 *		padding:2px 4px 4px 4px;
 * }
 *
 * But for your application suppose you want to tighten the padding
 * for buttons. Then, you might include the following style rule
 * in this file (assuming that you accept Maqetta's default where
 * id "myapp" is present on the BODY element, and assuming
 * that you are using the "claro" theme):
 *
 * #myapp.claro .dijitButton .dijitButtonNode {
 *		padding:1px 3px 3px 3px;
 * }
 *
 * Because of CSS precedence rules (see [1]), the above style rule
 * (which begins with #myapp.claro) will "win the cascade" versus 
 * the style rule from the theme CSS file due to the use of the
 * ID select (#myapp), which has higher specificity than the class
 * selectors used throughout the Claro theme.
 *

<a name="exploring_workspace_html_files"><h2>Exploring the HTML files created by Maqetta</h2></a>

<p>This part of the tutorial provides an overview of some technical details about
the HTML files that Maqetta creates:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Go to the New menu at the top of the application, and issue a "New HTML File" command to open
	up a new file within the Maqetta visual editor. You can either accept the default filename
	(e.g., <code>file1.html</code>) or enter a custom filename.</li>
<li>Go into top/bottom split view by clicking on Split Horizontally icon
	<img src="img/Maqetta-toolbar-splith.png" title="Split Horizontally" style="width:16px;height:16px;display:inline-block;margin:0;padding:0;"/>
	the last icon on the toolbar. Pull on the horiztonal divider until 
	all of the source code for application is visible. Your screen should
	look like this now:</p>
	<p><a href="img/HTML_Page_Initial_Split_View.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/HTML_Page_Initial_Split_View.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;" width="600" /></a></p>
</li>
<li>Drag/drop a Button widget onto the page. In the top pane, you should see a Button widget rendered on the 
	canvas. In the bottom pane (source view), you should see the following:
	<blockquote><strong>HTML source file contents</strong>
	<pre class="code_block_tight_spacing">

[18] &lt;/body>
[19] &lt;/html>
	</pre></blockquote>
<li>Some notes about the above HTML file listing:
	<ul>
		<li>Lines <code>[06]-[09]</code> - These lines load the CSS files used by this HTML file:
			<ul>
				<li><code>themes/claro/claro.css</code> - Reference to the CSS theme used by this page. (Default for Dojo/Dijit is the "claro" theme.)</li>
				<li><code>app.css</code> - Application-specific CSS style rules. (See discussion earlier in this tutorial about <code>app.css</code>.)</li>
				<li><code>dojo.css</code> - Some commonly used CSS rules provided by the Dojo toolkit.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="note">
				Note that Maqetta application will update the URL references to the above files automatically
				in various scenarios. For example, if you save an HTML file into a nested folder, 
				Maqetta will insert any necessary <code>../</code> references so that the HTML files
				will properly load the CSS files.
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>Line <code>[10]</code> - This line loads Dojo's JavaScript files.
			<div class="note">
				Note that Maqetta application will update the URL references to <code>dojo.js</code>
				in various scenarios. For example, if you save an HTML file into a nested folder, 
				Maqetta will insert any necessary <code>../</code> references so that the HTML files
				will properly load Dojo's JavaScript files.
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>Lines <code>[11]-[12]</code> - This is a Dojo-specific line of JavaScript.
			Dojo requires calls to <code>dojo.require()</code> for each widget type used
			by an HTML page. Maqetta automatically adds all necessary <code>dojo.require()</code>
			statements to the HTML page.
		</li>
		<li>Lines <code>[13]-[14]</code> - These lines include Maqetta-specific runtime JavaScript files
			These JavaScript files are necessary to make the application states feature work
			when your HTML page runs outside of the Maqetta authoring environment.
			<div class="note">
				In most cases, your development team will strip out these two <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
				elements in the process of transforming the Maqetta mockup into a production application.
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>Line <code>[16]</code> - The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element often includes some Maqetta-specific
			attributes that provide essential authoring information to the Maqetta page editor
			and/or are required so that the application states feature can run outside of the
			Maqetta authoring environment:
			<ul>
				<li><code>class="claro"</code> - The currently active theme name (in this case, "claro")
					appears in two places
					in the HTML source code: (1) within an @import command in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
					and as a class name on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.</li>
				<li><code>dvFlowLayout="true"</code> - This attribute persists whether this HTML file
					is currently being editing using flow layout or absolute layout.</li>
				<li><code>data-davinci-ws="collapse"</code> - This attribute allows Maqetta
					to work around HTML/CSS white space complexities. Without this attribute,
					Maqetta would either have to create unreadable source code or 
					fail to deliver on true WYWIWYG authoring.</li>
				<li><code>id="myapp"</code> - This attribute allows Maqetta to insert
					style rules within <code>app.css</code> file that reliably
					override style rules within the CSS themes. Typically, CSS themes
					use <em>class selectors</em> to style widgets and HTML.
					This allows Maqetta to create override CSS rules in <code>app.css</code>
					that reliably override the theme CSS rules because Maqetta's override
					CSS rules use <em>id selectors</em>, which have higher priority (i.e., "specificity") in CSS.
					<div class="note">Maqetta's override CSS rules always include <code>#myapp</code> at the
					beginning of the selector.</div>
					</li>
				<li><code>dvStates</code> attribute - (Not shown above) If an HTML page
					defines custom application states via the States palette, then the
					<code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element and various other elements within the page
					will include a <code>dvStates</code> attribute. The <code>dvStates</code> attribute 
					is necessary to make the application states feature work
					when your HTML page runs outside of the Maqetta authoring environment.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Line <code>[17]</code> - This line provides the declarative markup for the Button widget.
			Typically, each widget on the page will be represented in the HTML file as a single line of HTML.
			Some widgets, however, expand into multiple lines of HTML.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<a name="exploring_workspace_html_files"><h2>Exporting your entire workspace as a ZIP to give to developers</h2></a>

<p>Maqetta allows you to export your entire workspace or a subset of your workspace as a ZIP
file that can be handed to developers, who can then incrementally transform the UI mockup
created by Maqetta into a production application.
</p>

<p>To export your entire workspace as a ZIP file:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click on the first icon in the Files palette, the Download Entire Workspace icon
		<img src="img/download.gif" title="Download Entire Workspace" style="width:16px;height:16px;display:inline-block;margin:0;padding:0;"/>
		This brings up the following dialog:
		<p><a href="img/HTML_Page_Initial_Split_View.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/Download_Dialog.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;" /></a></p>
	</li>
	<li>Accept all of the defaults, and click on the OK button to download your entire workspace 
		as a ZIP file named <code>workspace1.zip</code>. This will initiate a browser downlaod
		action, with the download process happening the background.</li>
	<li>Invoke the browser's Download feature to look at all of the browser's recent downloads.
		In most browsers, the most recent download appears at the top. If the download is not
		yet completed, the browser usually will show download progress. Wait until the download is complete.</li>
	<li>Once the download has completed, using your local machine's features (e.g., Windows Explorer or Mac Finder),
		create a new empty folder and move or copy the downloaded ZIP file into that new folder,
		then unzip the ZIP file's contents into that folder.
		<div class="note">
			If you have a localhost web server on your machine, create the new empty folder
			somewhere within the web site contents area for your localhost web server.
			For example, we XAMPP or MAMP, the web site contents are stored in the <code>htdocs/</code>
			folder. This will allow you to actually run the Maqetta-created web pages
			on your localhost server.
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>Using either Windows Explorer or Mac Finder, examine the hierarchy of files after unzipping.
		You should see a local replica of your Maqetta workspace.</li>
</ul>

<a name="exploring_workspace_html_files"><h2>Exporting selected files from your workspace as a ZIP to give to developers</h2></a>

<p>To export only selected files within a ZIP file:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the Files palette, select all files that you would like to include in the download
		other than the <code>libs/</code> and <code>themes/</code> files. (The download
		dialog will allow you to include or exclude those files.)</li>
	<li>Click on the scond icon in the Files palette, the Download Selected Files icon
		<img src="img/download-selected-files.gif" title="Download Selected Files" style="width:16px;height:16px;display:inline-block;margin:0;padding:0;"/>
		This will bring up a similar download dialog as the 
		Download Entire Workspace icon.
	</li>
	<li>Then follow similar steps as described above for the Download Entire Workspace icon.</li>
</ul>

<a name="exploring_workspace_html_files"><h2>Download dialog options</h2></a>

<p>The download dialog provides the following options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Include/exclude particular libraries</strong> - The checkboxes to the left of the
		list of libraries and themes controls whether the given resources should be included 
		in the download ZIP file. By default, all JavaScript libraries (e.g., dojo) and the <code>themes</code>
		folder will be included in the download ZIP file.</p>
		<p>The decision whether to include particular JavaScript libraries in your download ZIP
		depends on the needs and constraints of the team that will receive the ZIP.
		Usually, you will want to collaborate with your development team to find out
		whether they want or do not want the libaries and/or themes within the ZIP.
		Three common scenarios:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>You probably would include all JavaScript libraries and themes if</em>
			you want the contents of the download ZIP to be a totally self-contained, runnable
			application that you can install on an arbitrary web server or localhost server.</li>
			<li><em>You probably would include a particular JavaScript libraries if</em>
			you have created an Eclipse-compatible project (see discussion of Eclipse-compatible projects below)
			and are handing the ZIP off to a development team that is using the Eclipse IDE.
			By including the JavaScript libraries, you will be providing a ZIP file that
			contains the equivalent of a self-contained Eclipse web project.</li>
			<li><em>You probably would <strong>not</strong> include a particular JavaScript libraries if</em>
			you are handing the ZIP off to a development team that is not using Eclipse and is familiar
			with the JavaScript libraries you are using in the UI mockups. The development
			team might not want the JavaScript libraries included in the ZIP because they
			may already have copies of the JavaScript libraries on their development systems
			and it is wasteful to include these (usually quite large) components if not needed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br/><br/>
	<li><strong>Relocate particular libraries</strong> - 
		Sometimes the development team sets up their folder hierarchy differently than
		how Maqetta sets up user workspaces. For example, by default Maqetta places
		the Dojo libraries at <code>./libs/dojo</code>, whereas the development team
		might place Dojo at a different location, such as <code>./js/dojo</code>, 
		<code>./dojo</code> or perhaps <code>../../libraries/dojo</code>.
		The editable textboxes within the dialog allow you to "relocate" the JavaScript
		libraries when the ZIP file is created to a n alternate location than what you are
		using in your Maqetta workspace. For example, if Dojo is located at <code>./lib/dojo</code>
		and your development team put the Dojo library at <code>./dojo</code>, then you
		can change the textbox from <code>lib/dojo</code> to <code>dojo</code>.
		Maqetta will automatically fix up the cloned copies of all HTML files in the ZIP
		file such that all URL references to Dojo will point to <code>./dojo</code>
		instead of <code>./lib/dojo</code>.
		<div class="note">
			Note that changing the textboxes in the download dialog only affect
			the cloned files within the ZIP. Your Maqetta workspace files remain
			as they were.
		</div>
	</li>
</ul>

<a name="exploring_workspace_html_files"><h2>Customizing your workspace to relocate JavaScript libraries</h2></a>

<p>The third icon at the top of the Files palettes allows you to permanently modify the folder
structure of your Maqetta workspace.</p>

<p><a href="img/modify_libraries_dialog.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/modify_libraries_dialog.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;"/></a></p>


<p>For example, by default, Maqetta places all JavaScript libraries
within the <code>./libs</code> folder, with the Dojo toolkit located at <code>./libs/dojo</code>.
These defaults usually work well for most Maqetta users. However, if your development team 
uses a different folder hierarchy, and you often create download ZIPs that you hand off to your developers,
then sometimes it will be more efficient and less error-prone if you customize your Maqetta workspace
to match the folder structure used by your developers. That way, when you create a download ZIP,
you won't need to relocate JavaScript libraries for each new ZIP file.
Maqetta will automatically fix up all HTML files in your workspace
to take into account the new location(s) for your JavaScript libraries.</p>

<a name="exporting_self_contained"><h2>Exporting self-contained projects to the Eclipse IDE and IBM Rational Application Developer (TM) 8.0</h2></a>

<p>This section is relevant to web development teams that use the Eclipse IDE or IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD) 8.0
and want to export a fully self-contained Eclipse project that can be imported simply into the Eclipse IDE.</p>


<p>Here are steps for creating a self-contained, Eclipse-compatible project, exporting as a ZIP, unzipping into your Eclipse workspace, and 
then importing the project into Eclipse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Before you create your HTML and CSS content, invoke the "New Project" command (found on the <b>New</b>
menu at the top of the application). In the dialog that appears, click on the "Eclipse support" checkbox. 
<div class="note">
This will create a new project in your Maqetta workspace. Because of the "Eclipse support" checkbox, the new project
will have a file hierarchy that matches the default file hierarchy used by the Eclipse IDE when creating
a web project. In particular, Maqetta will create a <code>WebContent/</code> folder. Additionally, 
Maqetta under the hood will create all of the hidden "dot files" (i.e., files whose name begins with a "." character)
used by the Eclipse IDE when managing web projects.
</div>
</li>

<li>After creating your Eclipse-compatible new project in Maqetta, then use the Maqetta visual page editor 
to create HTML pages. Make sure that your HTML files are all within the <code>WebContent/</code> folder
becauses that is what Eclipse expects.</li>

<li>Click on the Download Entire Workspace icon
<img src="img/download.gif" title="Download Entire Workspace" style="width:16px;height:16px;display:inline-block;margin:0;padding:0;"/>
within the Files palette and then click OK in the dialog that appears to accept the default options and start the download process.</li>

<li>Wait until the browser has completed the download.
(Because Dojo is included in the ZIP, the download might take some time to complete.)</li>

<li>On the same system where the Eclipse IDE is running, create a new folder (e.g., <code>maqetta_project1/</code>) 
somewhere on the disk.
Unzip the contents of the ZIP file into that folder.
When completed, you should see the <code>WebContent/</code> folder as a direct child of the new folder
(i.e., you should see <code>maqetta_project1/WebContent</code>).
<div class="note">
Warning about moving files around: Maqetta exports various "dot files" (i.e., hidden files that begin
with the letter "."). If you use the system explorer or finder to rearrange files and folders,
make sure that the dot files are moved along with any files or folders you move.
</div>
</li>

<li>In Eclipse, from the File menu, issue an Import command and choose "General>Existing Project Into Workspace". 
In the wizard that follows, choose the parent folder of the folder you created 
(e.g., the parent folder for <code>maqetta_project1/</code>). You should see the folder you created
(e.g., <code>maqetta_project1/</code>) in the list
of projects to import. Make sure the checkbox next to that folder is checked and then click "Finish".
</li>
<li>At this point, you should be able to use Eclipse features to edit the project you just imported.</li>
</ul>


<a name="exporting_without_Dojo"><h2>Exporting projects to IBM Rational Application Developer (TM) 8.0 without including the Dojo toolkit</h2></a>

<p>This section is relevant to web development teams that use IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD) 8.0
in conjunction with the Dojo Toolkit when the development team does not want the ZIP file exported from Maqetta to include
the Dojo toolkit inside.</p>

<p>To demonstrate Maqetta integration with RAD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch RAD</li>
<li>Issue a <code>New-&gt;Other...</code> command and then choose Web-&gt;Static Web Project. The following dialog will appear:
<p><a href="img/RAD_New_Static_Web_Project.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/RAD_New_Static_Web_Project.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt; height:400px;"/></a></p>
</li>
<li>Fill out the usual fields (e.g., project name) as you would normally,
but also click on the "Modify..." button so that you can tell RAD that you want to include the
Dojo facet as part of your static web project. This brings up the Project Facets dialog.
Open up the "Web 2.0" group and click on the checkbox next to "Dojo Toolkit":
<p><a href="img/RAD_Dojo_Project_Facet.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/RAD_Dojo_Project_Facet.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt; height:400px;"/></a></p>
And then click OK.
</li>
<li>Click Next until you get to the Dojo Project Setup dialog:
<p><a href="img/RAD_Dojo_Project_Setup_1.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/RAD_Dojo_Project_Setup_1.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt; height:400px;"/></a></p>
Click on the "Change these setup options" button. You will see the following wizard pane:
<p><a href="img/RAD_Dojo_Project_Setup_2.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/RAD_Dojo_Project_Setup_2.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt; height:400px;"/></a></p>
Notice that RAD provides three options for how to configure Dojo within your project:
<ol>
	<li>clone a copy of Dojo into the current project</li>
	<li>reference a copy of Dojo that is within a project in the current workspace</li>
	<li>reference Dojo off of a remote server (CDN)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Choose option 1 (clone a copy of Dojo into the current project) and click Next. You will see the following:
<p><a href="img/RAD_Dojo_Project_Setup_3.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/RAD_Dojo_Project_Setup_3.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt; height:400px;"/></a></p>
As you can see, RAD allows you to choose where you would like the Dojo toolkit to be located
within your current project (i.e., relative to the <code>WebContent\</code> folder). 
The dialog above shows the RAD's default location for Dojo: <code>dojo</code>.
<div class="note">
Maqetta uses a different default location for Dojo: : <code>lib/dojo</code>.
</div>
</li>
<li>Click Finish to create your static web project. If you look in the Project Explorer,
you will see a <code>dojo/</code> folder within the <code>WebContent/</code> folder for your new project.
</li>
<li>Go into the Maqetta application and click on the Download Entire Workspace icon
<img src="img/download.gif" title="Download Entire Workspace" style="width:16px;height:16px;display:inline-block;margin:0;padding:0;"/>
within the Files palette. In the Download dialog, uncheck the box next to "Dojo 1.7" 
(this causes the download ZIP to <em>not</em> include the Dojo JavaScript files)
and replace the string <code>lib/dojo</code> with the string <code>dojo</code>
(this causes all cloned HTML files that are included within the ZIP to look
for the Dojo JavaScript files at relative URL <code>./dojo</code> instead of relative URL <code>./lib/dojo</code>).
</li>
<li>Click OK to start the download process. </li>
<li>Wait until the browser has completed the download.
(Since Dojo was not included in the ZIP, the download should be completed quickly.)</li>
<li>Using an external utility (e.g., use a product like WinZip or operating system utilities), 
unzip the contents of the ZIP file into the <code>WebContent</code>
folder for your project. (You'll need to know where your Eclipse workspace is stored on your system.)
When completed, files such as <code>Sample1.html</code> and <code>app.css</code> should end up
in your <code>WebContent</code> folder.
</li>
<li>Back in RAD, issue a Refresh command on your new project. The files from the Maqetta ZIP should
appear in the Project Explorer.
</li>
<li>Find Sample1.html. Using the context menu, choose "Open With" and then "Web Browser".
You should see Sample.html running within the embedded Web browser that is part of RAD.
</li>
