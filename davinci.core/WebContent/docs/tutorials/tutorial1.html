<a name="pageeditor"><h2>The Maqetta Page Editor</h2></a>

<p>Upon launching Maqetta for the first time, the screen will look as follows:</p>

<div class="image">
<a href="img/Maqetta_UI_Initial.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/Maqetta_UI_Initial.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;" width="500" /></a>
<div>Click on the image to enlarge it.</div>
</div>

<p>Upon opening a file, the middle area becomes the page editor canvas. The following picture
shows how the application looks after opening up one of the sample files:</p>

<div class="image">
<a href="img/Maqetta_UI_Overview.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/Maqetta_UI_Overview.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;" width="500" /></a>
<div>Click on the image to enlarge it.</div>
</div>


<a name="newfile"><h2>Creating a new HTML page in the page editor</h2></a>

<ol>
<li>Click <b>New &gt; HTML File...</b> on the Maqetta menubar.</li>
<li>The <b>Create New HTML File</b> dialog will be displayed with a default filename.</li> 
<li>Click the <b>Create</b> button to create a new file with the default filename.</li>
<li>A new blank HTML file is opened in the page editor, with the filename displayed at the top.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your workspace should now look something like this:</p>
<div class="image">
<a href="img/PageEditorNewFile.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/PageEditorNewFile.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;" width="500" /></a>
<div>Click on the image to enlarge it.</div>
</div>

<a name="flow_vs_absolute"><h2>Flow layout versus absolute layout</h2></a>

<p>Maqetta defaults to <em>flow layout</em>. With flow layout, in most cases the page content 
begins at the top/left and then flows left-to-right and then top-to-bottom.
This is the "natural" layout approach used by HTML and CSS, whose original
designs were centered on flowable documents.
If you start adding simple UI controls such as buttons and textboxes to the page, you'll see that
the first widget snaps to the top/left of the page and the second widget will be placed either just to the right
of the first widget or just below the first widget.</p>

<p>Maqetta also supports <em>absolute layout</em>. With absolute layout, widgets and HTML elements
are placed at particular (x,y) locations on the page. Other sections of the documentation provide more
information about how to switch into absolute layout mode.</p>

<a name="dojo"><h2>Add Dojo controls to the page</h2></a>

<ol>
<li>In the <b>Widgets</b> palette, click on the <b>Dojo Controls</b> section to open that section.</li>
<li>Find the <b>Text Box</b> widget in the list of Dojo Controls. The controls are alphabetized, so
	the TextBox entry will be towards the bottom of the list of controls. Drag a TextBox widget onto the canvas.</li>
<li>Click on the Undo icon <img class="inline" src="img/undo.gif" /> on the toolbar. This will undo the previous
	operation, causing the TextBox widget to disappear. Now click on the Redo icon <img class="inline" src="img/redo.gif" />.
	The TextBox widget will re-appear.
	<div class="note">Maqetta supports multiple undo. Operations can be undone
	back to the last Open or Save operation.</div></li>
<li>Drag a <b>Button</b> widget onto the HTML page canvas to add a button to the page. 
Notice that Maqetta automatically pops up the widget's data entry popup so that you 
can immediately define the text for the button's label.
<p class="note">Maqetta automatically prompts the user for initial data for a number of widgets, 
such as Button, ComboBox, DataGrid, Tree, &lt;label&gt;, &lt;a&gt; and &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h3&gt;.</p>
</li>
<li>Enter some text (e.g., "Press me") and hit Return. You will see a button with the label you provided.</li>
<li>Double-click on the Button widget. Notice that Maqetta re-opens the data entry popup.</li>
<li>Change the text to say "Click-me" and hit Return.
</li>
<li>Drag a <b>Calendar</b>, <b>Color Palette</b> and <b>ComboBox</b> widget onto the canvas.
	Note that ComboBox pop ups a widget entry popup just like Button did. Click OK to accept the default data for ComboBox.
	<div class="note">
		Note that some widgets are added to the right of the previous widget and other widgets are added under the previous widget.
		This is because some widgets default as "block-level" widgets, which means they, in effect, also establish their own
		separate block (or "paragraph"), whereas other widgets are designed as "inline" widgets, which means they are placed inline
		within the current block (or "paragraph") and behave from a layout perspective similar to typed text or small inline images.
		Maqetta simply honors the default layout behavior for each widget.
		If you need to change between block and inline for a particular widget, you can go to the Properties palette,
		Layout section, and change the value of the 'display' property. 
		If you want an inline widget to be placed on a separate line below the previous widget,
		you can also use the context menu and issue a "Surround with DIV" command, which places the inline widget
		inside of the DIV element (and DIV elements defaults to block-level).

</li>
<li>In the <b>Widgets</b> palette, click on the <b>Dojo Controls</b> section title to close the section.</li>
</ol>


<a name="html"><h2>Add HTML elements to the page</h2></a>

<ol>
<li>In the <b>Widgets</b> palette, click on the <b>HTML</b> section to open that section.</li>
<li>Drag a <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> widget onto the canvas.</li>
<li>Drag a <b>&lt;label&gt;</b> widget onto the &lt;div&gt; on the canvas. This will put the &lt;label&gt; inside the &lt;div&gt;.</li>
<li>Enter some text for the &lt;label&gt; and hit Return.</li>
<li>Click on the <b>HTML</b> section title to close the section.</li>
</ol>

<a name="image"><h2>Add an image to the page</h2></a>

<ol>
<li>The <b>Files</b> palette is in the lower-left section of the Maqetta workspace.</li>
<li>You can expand the palette by placing the mouse on the upper edge of the blue divider and dragging up with the mouse.</li> 
<li>From the <b>Files</b> palette, drag and drop the &quot;SampleBanner.jpg&quot; file onto the page canvas.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">To add your own images, right-click (ctrl-click on the Mac) on the 
<b>Files</b> palette to bring up the context menu, and select <b>Upload File</b>. 
Uploaded files are displayed in the Files palette where you can drag and drop them onto the canvas
or reference them from 'background-image' properties.</p>


<a name="workwidgets"><h2>Working with widgets</h2></a>

<p>To work with a widget, you must first select it. You can then size it, move it, style it or set its properties.</p>

<h3>Selecting a widget</h3>

<p>You can select a widget in three ways:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Click on a widget on the page canvas.</li>
 <li>Click on a widget&#39;s entry in the Outline palette.</li>
 <li>In split view (where both the design canvas and HTML source are visible at the same time),
 	you can often select part or all of the source code corresponding to a particular widget,
 	and often the given widget will show as selected on the page canvas.</li>
</ul>

<p>A gray border is displayed around a widget to show that it is selected.</p>

<p>You can select multiple widgets by holding down the <b>Ctrl</b> key (Command key on Mac) as you select the widgets.</p>

<h3>Resizing, moving and styling a widget</h3>

<ul>
<li>To change the size of a widget, select it and pull one of the resize handles 
(small white boxes along the corners and sides of the selection border).
<p class="note">Some widgets such as Button do not have resize handles because their size depends on their interior content.</p>
</li>
</ul> 

<ul>
<li>In <em>flow layout</em>, you can move widgets in two ways:
<ul>
<li>On the canvas, select the widget, then place the mouse on the selection border and then drag it to a different location
	within the existing "flow" of widgets.</li>
<li>On the Outline palette, drag the widget to a new location within the Outline palette. (The Outline palette allows widgets to be moved into any position in the widget hierarchy.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In <em>absolute layout</em>, you can also drag widgets to different locations. However, the effect or rearranging absolutely positioned widgets
within the Outline palette is more complex:
<ul>
<li>Widgets may or not not move to different physical locations on the canvas if they are moved to a different location
in the Outline palette.</li>
<li>Moving widgets in the Outline palette will alter drawing order, and 
therefore might cause one widget to draw behind or in front of other widgets.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Sometimes layout rules with Maqetta can be complex because fundamentally Maqetta
is a WYSIWYG authoring tool for HTML5 and CSS3. 
Maqetta creates HTML and CSS source files
which are ultimately passed to the browser for layout and rendering. 
Because the layout rules for HTML and CSS are sometimes complex,
if you reorder widgets in the Outline palette, hand-edit source code and/or change property values on widgets
in the Properties palette, then you are altering the HTML and CSS source files that are sent to the browser,
which might trigger various complex CSS layout rules and thereby produce visual results different than 
what you expected. Maqetta tutorials attempt to demonstrate authoring techniques that 
minimize chances of confusing results.</p> 

<h3>Nesting widgets</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can nest widgets by dragging and dropping a widget onto another widget (the target must be a container widget).</li>
<li>Nested widgets can be moved into a different container widget, or outside of any widgets to become a top-level widget on the page.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">In certain scenarios, nesting widgets might
affect how some CSS properties are inherited, and therefore might affect the visual styling of a particular widget.</p>

<h3>Styling widgets</h3>
<ul>
<li>To change the look of a widget, click on the widget to select it and then change its values using the Properties palette.</li>
</ul>

<a name="deletewidgets"><h2>Deleting widgets</h2></a>

<ol>
<li>Select one of the widgets in the Page Editor canvas.</li>
<li>Delete the widget in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Click on the <b>delete</b> <img class="inline" src="img/delete_icon.png" /> icon on the page editor toolbar.</li>
<li>Hit the <b>Delete</b> key on your keyboard (for Windows only - currently not working on the Mac).
<li>Bring up the widget's context menu (right-click on Windows / ctrl-click on Mac) and choose <b>delete</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>You can also delete a widget from the Outline palette:
<ol>
<li>Select the widget in the Outline palette</li>
<li>Bring up the widget's context menu (right-click on Windows / ctrl-click on Mac) and choose <b>delete</b>.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<a name="saveopen"><h2>Saving and opening files</h2></a>

<p>Click on the <b>Save</b> <img class="inline" src="img/save_icon.png" /> icon on the page editor toolbar to save the current HTML file.</p>

<h3>Saving with <b>Save as</b></h3>
<p>Use <b>Save as</b> to save the file under a different file name:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <b>Save as</b> <img class="inline" src="img/Maqetta-toolbar-saveas.png" /> icon on the page editor toolbar.</li>
<li>A dialog window will pop up with the directory list from your user workspace folder (which is also displayed in the Files palette).</li>
<li><b>File name:</b> - enter a new file name or select an existing file from the list (using an existng filename will overwrite the existing file).</li>
<li><b>Parent folder:</b> - select any folder from the list (the root user workspace folder is indicated by a "."). 
<i>Do not use the <b>themes</b> folder since this is reserved for Maqetta theme files.</i></li>
<li>The file will be saved with the new file name, and will also remain open on the canvas with the new file name.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Opening Files</h3>
<p>There are two ways to open an existing file:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the file in the <b>Files</b> palette and double-click on it.</li>
<li>Select <b>Open > Open File...</b> from the Maqetta menu bar. A dialog window will pop up allowing you to select the file to open.</li>
