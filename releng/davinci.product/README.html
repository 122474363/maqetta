<h1>Installing and Launching Maqetta on Localhost</h1>

<h2>Supported browsers: Google Chrome (current release), Mozilla Firefox 3.5+ and Mac Safari 5</h2>
<p>
The current builds of Maqetta only run on Google Chrome, Firefox 3.5+ and Safari 5 on the Mac. 
</p>
<p>
In general, Maqetta runs faster Chrome, Firefox4 and Safari than on Firefox 3.5, 
and we therefore recommend that people use Chrome, Safari or Firefox4. 
</p>

<h2>Make sure you have a clean setup: restart browser and clear caches</h2>

<p>Before opening up a new Maqetta Preview release in your browser, we
recommend that you close and restart your browser and clear its caches.
These steps are likely not necessary in most cases, but recommended nevertheless during 
the "Preview" phase of the open source project because
we aren't sure yet that we have dealt with Maqetta's caching logic completely.
<em>These procedures are likely more important for people 
who have used previous versions of Maqetta.</em></p>

<h2>Detailed instructions for clearing caches in various browsers</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Quit and restart your browser before launching a new version of Maqetta for the first time.</strong>
		For most users, this is probably unnecessary, but
		recommended nonetheless. 
		We have found occasional issues with Google Chrome when switching from an old version
		of Maqetta to a newer version. </li>
	<li><strong>Clear both the browser's cache and its "appcache" (offline storage):</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Chrome
				<ul>
				 	<li>(Windows only): Click on the tools icon (looks like a wrench) and choose "Options".
				 		This will open a new browser tab.</li>
				 	<li>(Mac only) Under the "Chrome" menu, choose "Preferences".
				 		This will open a new browser tab.</li>
				 	<li>Click on the "Under the Hood" hyperlink.</li>
					<li>Clear cache: While in the "Under the Hood" tab, click on "Clear browsing data".
						In the dialog that follows, make sure "Empty the cache" is checked.
						You might want to uncheck the other items so that other things are not also cleared.
						Now, click on the "Clear browsing data" button.</li>
					<li>Clear appcache (offline storage): Click on "Content settings...." to bring up the Content Settings dialog.
						With "Cookies" highlighted in left column, click on "Show cookies and other site data".
						Under "Search", type the name of the server from which you are running Maqetta.
						If you installed locally, type "localhost". If running off of http://maqetta.org,
						then type "maqetta". 
						In tree view, open up the the tree item for the server (i.e., "localhost" or "maqetta.org").
						If there is an entry labeled "Application Caches", open that tree item. Either
						select the "Application Caches" tree item or the sub-item that corresponds to the Maqetta server,
						and click the "Remove" button at the bottom.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Firefox
				<ul>
					<li>(Windows only): On main menubar, invoke Tools->Options. 
						This brings up the Options dialog. 
						Click on the "Advanced" button
						and then click on the "Network" tab.</li>
				 	<li>(Mac only) Under the "Firefox" menu, choose "Preferences".
						Click on the "Advanced" button
						and then click on the "Network" tab.</li>
					<li>Clear cache: Under "Offline Storage", click on "Clear Now".</li>
					<li>Clear appcache: Under "Offline Storage", at the bottom is a
						box labelled as follows: "The following websites have stored data for offline use:".
						See if the server which hosts Maqetta is listed. 
						If you installed locally, the server is "localhost". 
						If running off of http://maqetta.org,
						the server is "maqetta.org". 
						If the Maqetta server is listed, click on it and then click "Remove" (and then "Remove offline data").
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Safari
				<ul>
				 	<li>(Mac only) Under the "Safari" menu, invoke the "Empty cache..." command to clear both the browser cache and the application cache.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for installing and running Maqetta locally</h2>

<p>Use these instructions for installing and running Maqetta locally (i.e. http://localhost:50000).</p>

<h3>Step 1: Verify you have Java Version 5 installed on your machine.</h3>

<p>Maqetta requires Java Version 5 (i.e. JRE Version 1.5), installed on your machine in order to run Maqetta locally.<br />
Follow these steps to check your Java version:</p>

<ol><li> Open a Command Prompt window
<ul><li>On Windows: Click <b>Start > Run</b>, type in <code style="letter-spacing:1px;">cmd</code> and click OK</li>
    <li>On Mac: Open <b>Finder > Applications > Utilites > Terminal</b></li></ul>
<li>Type in <code>java -version</code></li>
<li>If the version number 1.5.0 or higher, no further action is required.</li>
<li>If the version number is lower than 1.5.0, or you don't have Java on your machine, then you'll need to install
	Java 1.5 (or later) onto your machine.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Launch the Maqetta server</h3>

<ol><li> With the Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac), navigate to the directory into which you unzipped the Maqetta files.
</li><li> Launch the Maqetta server process.
<ul><li> On Windows, double-click on the file <b>maqetta.local.win.bat</b> (depending on your settings, the Windows explorer might not show the &quot;.bat&quot; extension).
</li><li> On Mac, double-click on the file <b>maqetta.local.mac.command</b> (depending on your settings, the Mac finder might not show the &quot;.command&quot; extension).

</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<p> </p>

<p>You can tell that the server has launched if you see the following message in the shell window:
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<pre>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />NOTE: CLOSING THIS WINDOW WILL <br />      STOP THE MAQETTA SERVER PROCESS<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Using directory : &lt;maqetta-unzip-dir&gt;\users<br />start your browser at http://localhost:50000/maqetta<br /><br />osgi&gt;</pre>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<p>The Maqetta server will continue to run until you close the shell window that comes up after you double-click on the server launch file. Therefore, if you close the shell window, the Maqetta server process will stop running, at which point you can't run <a href="http://localhost:50000/maqetta" rel="external" title="http://localhost:50000/maqetta">http://localhost:50000/maqetta</a> anymore. <br /></p>
<p><i><font color="#ff0000"><b><u>One possible problem</u></b> <font color="#000000">is that you might already be running a different localhost server on your system at <b><u>http://localhost:50000</u></b> (the default for Maqetta). Refer to the detailed notes immediately below about how to change the Maqetta launch script to use a different port number.</font></font></i><br /></p><p /><p><b><i>Detailed notes about the Maqetta server <br /></i></b></p>

<ul><li>On the Mac, you can launch the Maqetta server from the Dock by dragging the <code>maqetta.local.mac.command</code> onto the right part of the doc.</li>
<li>The launch scripts (<b>maqetta.local.win.bat</b> and <b>maqetta.local.mac.command</b>) have some default parameters:
<ul>
<li><b>HTTP port number</b> - The scripts default to port 50000. If you prefer to use 8080 or some other port number, hand-edit the launch script 
and change 50000 to something else (any number in the 50000's is OK).
</li><li><b>User workspace folder</b> - Any files that you create in Maqetta will be saved into a folder managed by the Maqetta server process. You can change the location for where your workspace is saved by hand-editing the launch scripts. <i><b>Note that a future version of Maqetta will allow you to open any file on your local system. The current release can only open files within the workspace area.</b></i><br /><br />The default <b>user workspace folder</b> locations are:<br /><br />

<ul><li>Windows: &lt;maqetta-unzip-dir&gt;\users</li>
<li>Macintosh: &lt;maqetta-unzip-dir&gt;/users</li></ul>

</li></ul>
</li></ul>


<h3>Step 3: Launch Maqetta application in Google Chrome, Firefox 3.5+ or Mac Safari</h3>

<p>Once the Maqetta server has been launched (see previous steps), open Chrome, Firefox or Safari and go to the following URL: 
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="http://localhost:50000/maqetta" rel="external" title="http://localhost:50000/maqetta">http://localhost:50000/maqetta</a>
</li></ul>

<h2>HTML5 appcache - say yes to the "Allow" prompt</h2>
<p>
Maqetta now takes advantage of a recent HTML5 feature shipping in modern browsers - the HTML appcache.
This allows the browser to save a cached version of large parts of Maqetta on your local computer,
thereby significantly improving performance, particularly if the network is slow.
The first time you launch Maqetta, you may see a prompt asking you to allow Maqetta
to store offline data. Click "Allow" so that Maqetta performance will be optimized.
