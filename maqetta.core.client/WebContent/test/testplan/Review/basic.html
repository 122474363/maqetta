	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li><strong>You'll need to run the application on a server that is integrated with sendmail. </strong>
			In fact, best to test on multiple server configurations because a large part of the user management and sendmail logic
			is stored in a server-dependent logic. The default build when pulling down sources from github
			uses a bare-bones user management system without hookup to sendmail. There is a special OSGi plugin
			specifically for http://maqetta.org that integrates with that server's user management system
			and sendmail. Company-specific builds are likely to add their own OSGi plugin to integrate with
			the company's LDAP and sendmail.</li>
		<li><strong>You'll need multiple logins for each test server. </strong>
			Best if there are at least 3 logins available (users A, B and C), each with their own separate email addresses,
			where you are able to process the mail for those email addresses. (e.g., Suppose you are John Smith.
			You might have these email addresses under your control: JohnSmith@MyCompany.Com, JohnSmith@me.com, JohnSmith@gmail.com.)
			For internal company LDAP environments, where people often cannot create dummy email addresses,
			it might be necessary to have 3 people work together on these tests.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 class="test_section">Create a new review</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Login to the server as user A and open up the application.</li>
		<li>Invoke New Review... from the New menu at the top of the application.</li>
		<li>In the wizard that comes up, on the first pane, enter information for each field. Click on the Next button.</li>
		<li>On the second pane, double-click on Sample1.html to make it one of the selected files. Click on the Next button.</li>
		<li>On the third pane, enter the email addresses for users B and C. Click on the Publish button and watch the lower-right corner of the screen for a green popup message.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>As you type in the text field, selectable suggestions should be listed (assuming there's a match). A new search should occur (with some slight delay) with each keystroke.</li>
			<img src="images/reviewAndCommentingUserSuggestion.png" >
			<li>Once a user has been added to a review his photo should appear in the grid (on servers where the user management system includes photos). </li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>Potentially after a few seconds, a green popup should appear saying that reviewers have been successfully invited.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 class="test_section">Receiving a review invitation</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>As users A, B and C, login to your mail client and look for email review invitations.
		  <div class='expectedResults_subsection'>You should see an email review invitation that includes
		  	short explanation and a hyperlink for running the review software.</div>
		</li>
		<li>As user B, either using a different browser or a different computer,
			activate the hyperlink.
		  <div class='expectedResults_subsection'>You should be directed to the Maqetta server.
		  	In almost all cases, you will be prompted to create a new user or login as an existing user.
		  	In many systems (particularly http://maqetta.org) after completely the new user or login processes,
		  	you should be taken to the review UI rather than the page editor UI.</div>
		</li>
		<li>Once Maqetta UI appears, you should be taken directly to the review.
		  	<div class='expectedResults_subsection'>You should see:
			  	<ul>
			  		<li><i>Sample1.html.rev</i> in an open editor. </li>
			  		<li>Reviews palette brought to the front.</li>
			  		<li>Within the Reviews palette, the node for the review should be opened, and <i>Sample1.html.rev</i> 
			  			should be selected.</li>
			  		<li>Comments palette brought to the front.</li>
			  	</ul>
		  	</div>
		</li>

	<h2 class="test_section">Adding review comments and annotations</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Continuing as user B, in the Comments palette, click on the "add comment" icon on the toolbar.
			<div class='expectedResults_subsection'>A small comment entry form should appear just under the toolbar.</div>
			Enter some text for the subject and some text for the description. Click Submit.
			<div class='expectedResults_subsection'>The comment should be added to the top of the Comments palette
			with a solid color border (e.g., blue) with "Edit" and "Reply" hyperlinks at top.</div>
		</li>
		<li>Continuing as user B, in the Comments palette, click on the "add comment" icon again.
			Add a second comment, but before hitting Submit, add a circle/oval invitation to the page
			by clicking on the circle/oval icon and then dragging out a circle. After dragging the circle,
			verify that the circle can be moved and resized.
			<div class='expectedResults_subsection'>The circle should be the same color as the border shown
			on your comments in the Comments palette.</div>
		</li>
		<li>Continuing as user B, in the States palette, switch to the "Add Task" state.
			<div class='expectedResults_subsection'>The "Add new task" dialog should appear on canvas.</div>
			Add a 3rd comment, along with each of the other annotation types (text, rectangle, arrow).
			Verify the each of these annotations types can be moved and resized.
			Click Submit.</li>
		<li>In States palette, switch to "Task Added" state.
			<div class='expectedResults_subsection'>The annotations for the "Add Task" state should disappear.</div>
			In States palette, switch to "Normal" state.
			<div class='expectedResults_subsection'>The annotations for the "Add Task" state should continue to be hidden.</div>

		  <div class='expectedResults_subsection'>You should see the annotations that user B
		  	added to the "Add Task" state.</div>

	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>As user A, login to your mail client and look for notifications that comments have been added to your review.
		  <div class='expectedResults_subsection'>For each new comment, you should see an email that includes details about the 
		  	comment. In addition, there should be a link to your review (the same link that was 
		  	in the review invitation). It should look something like the screenshot below:</div>
		  	<img src="images/commentNotificationEmail.png" >
		</li>
		<li>As user A, open Maqetta either by:
			<ul>
				<li> clicking on the link in the notification e-mail</li>
				<li> going to Reviews palette, opening up the latest review session by clicking on "+", and then
					double-clicking on Sample1.html.rev. </li>
			</ul>
		  <div class='expectedResults_subsection'>The review should open in a new editor tab.</div></li>

			in editor tabs before the reload are reopened.
