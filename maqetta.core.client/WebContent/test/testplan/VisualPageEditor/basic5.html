	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Standard setup things: Clear the browser cache. Launch the Maqetta server. 
				Login if necessary. 
				In some cases, you'll want to setup a virgin user environment by creating a whole new user login.</li>
		<li>Click on the "New file" icon on the main toolbar. Set composition type to "Desktop hi-fi sketch". Choose any filename.</li>
		<li>For each of the following widgets, click on the widget in the Widgets palette, and subsequently
				drag out a rectangle on the canvas to define the initial size of the widget, making sure
				no widgets overlap:
			<ul>
				<li>TabContainer</li>
				<li>HTML DIV</li>
				<li>HTML BUTTON</li>
				<li>A couple of clipart widgets (e.g., Home and Map)</li>
				<li>A couple of shape widgets (e.g., Rectangle and Line)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Drag/drop a Dojo Button and ComboBox into middle of the TabContainer.</li>
		<li>Drag/drop a Dojo Checkbox and RadioButton into middle of the DIV</li>
		<li>Move mouse to various positions on the canvas, mouse down, and drag out various selection rectangles,
			surrounding some of the widgets. Sometimes start the drag/select when over the background,
			sometimes start the drag/select when over an empty area of the TabContainer,
			sometimes start the drag/select when over an empty area of the DIV,
			sometimes start the drag/select when over a primitive widget such as a Button.
			<div class='expectedResults_subsection'>
				<ul>
					<li>If you start the drag over a currently selected widget, 
						the drag operation should move that widget</li>
					<li>If you start the drag over an unselected widget and that widget
						is not a container widget, the drag operation should select and then move that widget</li>
					<li>If you start the drag over the white area of a container (TabContainer or DIV),
						then the drag operation should show a dashed selection rectangle,
						and all widgets inside that selection rectangle should be selected.</li>
					<li>If you start the drag over the white area of the page background,
						then the drag operation should show a dashed selection rectangle,
						and all widgets inside that selection rectangle should be selected.</li>
					<li>Note that if a parent widget is selected, then none of its children should be selected -
						the visual editor's drag/select logic should prevent simultaneous selection of a widget and
						any of its descendants.</li>
				</ul>
			</div></li>
		<li>Open Sample1.html</li>
		<li>With the mouse over the white area to the right of the TabContainer,
			drag out a few selection rectangles that cover some of the widgets in the file.
			<div class='expectedResults_subsection'>
				<ul>
					<li>All widgets within the drag/select's rectangle should be selected.</li>
					<li>Note that if a parent widget is selected, then none of its children should be selected -
						the visual editor's drag/select logic should prevent simultaneous selection of a widget and
						any of its descendants.</li>
				</ul>
