<h1>Tutorial 4 - Cloud Workspace, Files, Projects and Orion Navigator</h1>

<div class='note'>
	When going through Maqetta's tutorials, it is suggested that you have two side-by-side
	browser windows open, one showing the tutorial, and the other where you run the application
	and perform the steps listed in the tutorial.<br/>
	<img src='img/SideBySideTutorialsApp.png' class='side_by_side'/>
</div>

<p>This tutorial provides an overview of the features in Maqetta having to do
with your cloud workspace. Topics covered:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Files palette</li>
	<li>Creating and Opening Files</li>
	<li>Opening Files from the Files Palette</li>
	<li>Files Palette Context Menu</li>
	<li>Files Palette Toolbar</li>
	<li>Creating and Switching Projects</li>
	<li>Orion Navigator</li>
</ul>

<a id='Files_palette'></a>
<h2>Files Palette</h2>

<p><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Open up the <strong>Files</strong> palette (found in the left/bottom corner of the application).
	If the palette isn't showing, click on the large-size <strong>Files</strong> palette icon to show
	the <strong>Files</strong> palette.
	The <strong>Files</strong> palette should look something like this:</p>
	
<div class='overview_snapshots_outer'>
	<span class='overview_snapshots_inner'>
		<img src="img/Files_palette_initial.png" style='width:300px;'/> 
	</span>
</div>

<p>What you are seeing is your personal cloud workspace.
	Maqetta creates a default project (<em>project1</em>) for each new user,
	and puts a set of default files in the newly created project:</p>
<ul>
	<li class='multipara_bullet'><div><strong>app.css</strong> - 
		This file is the default location for project-level CSS style rules.
		Maqetta includes app.css in all of the HTML files it creates.</div>
		<div>Some of the advanced features found in Maqetta's various properties palettes
		(found at the right/top of the application, such as Layout, Margins, etc) 
		will automatically add CSS style rules to this file. You can also double-click
		on this file to bring up Maqetta's source editor so that you can add
		CSS style rules manually.</div></li>
	<li class='multipara_bullet'><div><strong>app.js</strong> - 
		This file is the default location for project-level JavaScript logic.
		Maqetta includes app.js in all of the HTML files it creates.</div>
		<div>Beginning users typically do not touch this file, but advanced users
		often find the need to put custom JavaScript logic in this file.</div></li>
	<li><strong>lib</strong> - 
		Holds the JavaScript libraries (e.g., Dojo) that will
		be used by the HTML files you create.</li>
	<li><strong>samples</strong> - 
		Contains various sample files, including various files that are
		used as part of Maqetta's tutorials.</li>
	<li><strong>themes</strong> - 
		Contains various the CSS themes, both the ones that ship standard
		with Maqetta, and user-created themes.</li>
</ul>


<a id='Creating_opening_files'></a>
<h2>Creating and Opening Files</h2>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Go to the <strong>Create</strong> menu 
	<img src="img/Create_button.png"  class='exact_size_inline_icon'/> 
	at the top of the application.
	Choose the command <strong>Create -&gt; Desktop Application...</strong>.
	In the dialog that appears, accept the defaults and click on the "Create" button.
</div>
<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Go to the <strong>Palette</strong> and find the section labelled "Containers".
	Click on the "Containers" section to show its contents, and then click on the
	"Dojo" sub-section to show its contents.</div>

<div class='overview_snapshots_outer'>
	<span class='overview_snapshots_inner'>
		<img src="img/widgets_containers_dojo.png" style='height:400px; width:auto;'/> 
	</span>
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	You should see various widget icons. Find the TabContainer widget.
	With the mouse, drag the icon for the TabContainer widget from the 
	Palette onto the white canvas (in the middle of the application).
	Drop the TabContainer somewhere inside of the white canvas.
	A TabContainer widget should appear at the top/left of the canvas,
	and a popup dialog should appear. Click OK in that popup dialog to accept its default values.
	Your canvas should look something like this:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div class='overview_snapshots_outer'>
	<span class='overview_snapshots_inner'>
		<img src="img/default_tab_container.png" style='height:auto; width:600px;'/> 
	</span>
</div>

<p>Now let's look at the various parts of the Maqetta user interface. Observe the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Files palette</strong> - Observe that the filename of the file you just
	created (e.g., file1.html) is now listed in the <strong>Files</strong> palette.</li>
	<li><strong>File tabs</strong> - Look at the file tab area at the top of the application
		(just under the main menubar and just above the page editor's toolbar).
		Find the file tab for the file you just created. Observe that it contains
		an asterisk next to the filename 
		to indicate that the file has unsaved changes.</li>
</ul>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button 
	<img src="img/save_icon.png"  class='exact_size_inline_icon'/> 
	on the page editor toolbar to save your document.
	Notice that the asterisk goes away after the save operation.
</div>

<a id='Previewing_files'></a>
<h2>Previewing Files</h2>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Click on the <strong>Preview</strong> icon 
	<img src="img/preview-browser.png"  class='exact_size_inline_icon'/> 
	on the page editor toolbar.
	Notice that a new browser tab (or window) opens showing the TabContainer widget.
	(In Maqetta, this is called "Preview in browser".)
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	In the browser tab that just opened, select the full URL from the browser's URL address bar,
	and issue a system copy command (e.g., Ctrl-C on Windows or Cmd-C on Mac) to put the URL
	onto the system clipboard.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Open a different browser (if you have multiple browsers on your system), 
	open up a new browser tab in that browser, and issue a paste command into that
	browser's URL bar. You should see your file previewed in the other browser.
</div>

<div class='note'>
	What this shows is that each of your files in your cloud workspace has its own URL
	that you can share with others (assuming your colleagues also can
	access the Maqetta server).
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Click on the file tab's close button -
	<img src='img/close_sel.gif' class='exact_size_inline_icon'/>
	- to close the page editor. </div>

<a id='Opening_files_from_Files_palette'></a>
<h2>Opening Files from the Files Palette</h2>
	
<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Go to the <strong>Files</strong> palette and double-click on the file you just
	created to reopen that file. </div>

<div class='note'>
	When you double-click on an HTML file in the <strong>Files</strong> palette,
	Maqetta opens in the visual page editor.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	In the <strong>Files</strong> palette, double-click on the <strong>app.css</strong> file.
	Maqetta will open up a source editor where you can edit the source code of that CSS file.</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Now, double-click on the <strong>app.js</strong> file.
	Maqetta will open up a source editor where you can edit the source code of that JavaScript file.</div>

<div class='note'>
	When you double-click on CSS (*.css), JavaScript (*.js) or JSON file (*.json)
	in the <strong>Files</strong> palette,
	Maqetta opens up a source editor for the given file.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	For each of the open files, click on the file tab's close button -
	<img src='img/close_sel.gif' class='exact_size_inline_icon'/>
	- to close all of the editors. </div>

<a id='File_palette_context_menu'></a>
<h2>Files Palette Context Menu</h2>

<p>In the <strong>Files</strong> palette, you can create folders, delete files, rename files, 
	upload files, and download files.</p>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Go to the <strong>Files</strong> palette, put the mouse over the
	<strong>app.css</strong> file, and bring up the context menu
	(e.g., using right-mouse-button or Ctrl-click on a Mac). You should see the following
	commands in the popup menu.</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>New folder...</strong> - Adds a new folder to your cloud workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Upload files...</strong> - Allows you to upload files from your computer
		to your cloud workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Rename...</strong> - Allows you to rename files.</li>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	The Create New Folder dialog will appear. Accept the default values and click on the "Create button".
	A new folder with an automatically generated name (e.g., "folder1") will appear in the Files palette.</div>
<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	In the <strong>Files</strong> palette, put the mouse over the folder you just created
	(e.g., "folder1"),
	bring up the context menu, and choose the "Rename..." command. 
	Enter "images" as the new name for the folder, and click on the Rename button.
	Notice in the <strong>Files</strong> palette that the folder has been renamed
	to "images".</div>
<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	In the <strong>Files</strong> palette, put the mouse over the "images"
	folder, bring up the context menu,
	and once again choose the "New Folder..." command. In the Create New Folder
	dialog, type "abc" into the folder name textbox, then click on the Create button.
	Note that new folder "abc" is now a child of folder "images".</div>
<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	In the <strong>Files</strong> palette, put the mouse over the "abc" folder,
	bring up the context menu, and choose the "Delete..." command. An "Are you sure"
	dialog will appear. Click OK. Notice that folder "abc" has been removed from the Files palette.</div>
<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Outside of Maqetta, find one or more image files on your computer (preferably, not massive).

</div>
<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	The Download dialog will provide a default file name for a ZIP file
	that will hold the currently selected files (e.g., project1.zip),
	and it will show the list of files you have selected
	(in this case, "images"). Click on the Download button.</div>
<div class='note'>
	File project1.zip will now be in your browser's Downloads folder.
	The ZIP file will contain the full contents of your "images" folder.</div>

	dialog will appear. Click OK. Notice that folder "images" has been removed from the Files palette.</div>

<a id='File_palette_context_menu'></a>
<h2>Files Palette Toolbar</h2>

<p>The <strong>Files</strong> palette has a toolbar with 3 icons:
	<img src='img/Files_palette_toolbar.png' class='exact_size_inline_icon'/>.
	The three icons are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Download entire project</strong> -
		This command will download the full contents of your current project within a ZIP file.
		<div class='note'>
		You can take the contents of the ZIP file for your project and unzip into the 
		<em>htdocs</em>, <em>public_html</em> or <em>www</em> folder within a web server,
		and you will have deployed your Maqetta-created sketch or prototype on that web server.
		Assuming you accept the default download options,
		the ZIP file will contain all of the files needed to successfully view your
		creation, including necessary JavaScript libraries and CSS themes.</div></li>
	<li><strong>Download selected files</strong> -
		This icon will create a ZIP file that only contains the files that
		are currently selected in the Files palette. 
		This icon is equivalent to the Download command on the Files palette context menu.</li>
	<li><strong>Modify libraries</strong> -
		This icon allows you to move your JavaScript libraries to different locations within
		your current project. By default, JavaScript libraries are located in your <code>libs</code>
		folder. The typical reason for moving your JavaScript libraries is if your development team
		requests that you send them prototypes where the JavaScript libaries are in a particular location.
		Note that Maqetta will do its best to update all references to JavaScript libaries
		in your HTML files so that the HTML files will continue to work properly after 
		the JavaScript libraries have been moved.</li>
</ul>


<a id='Projects'></a>
<h2>Creating and Switching Projects</h2>

<p>When a user launches Maqetta for the first time, Maqetta creates a default project (named "project1").
	Maqetta includes a <strong>Create -&gt; New Project</strong> command that allows users
	to create whole new projects.</p>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Go to the <strong>Create</strong> menu 
	<img src="img/Create_button.png"  class='exact_size_inline_icon'/> 
	at the top of the application.
	Choose the command <strong>Create -&gt; Project...</strong>.
	In the dialog that appears, enter "temp1" as the name of the new project,
	and click the "Create button".
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	The Maqetta browser window will now redraw.
	Go to the <strong>Files</strong> palette, and you will see that
	the project name (listed at the top of the <strong>Files</strong> palette) is now "temp1".
	Also note that the <strong>Files</strong> palette contents shows the same
	default contents (app.css, app.js, libs, samples, themes) as when you first launched
	the Maqetta application.
</div>

<div class='note'>
	The <strong>Create -&gt; Project...</strong> command is useful if you are using
	Maqetta for different work projects, or if you find the need to restart work
	from scratch.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	At the top of the <strong>Files</strong> palette, in the the drop-down menu next to the
	current project name (i.e., "temp1"), choose project "project1".
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Let's now delete the "temp1" project. At the top of the <strong>Files</strong> palette,
	click on the Delete Project icon
	<img src="img/remove.gif"  class='exact_size_inline_icon'/>.
	After deleting this project, Maqetta will switch back to one of your other existing
	projects (e.g., "project1").
	The Maqetta browser window will now redraw, and the <strong>Files</strong> palette
	will show the contents of the "project1" project.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Using the drop-down menu at the top of the <strong>Files</strong> palette,
	switch back to the "temp1" project. 
	Let's now delete the "temp1" project. At the top of the <strong>Files</strong> palette,
	click on the Delete Project icon
	<img src="img/remove.gif"  class='exact_size_inline_icon'/>.
	After deleting this project, Maqetta will switch back to one of your other existing
	projects (e.g., "project1").
</div>

<div class='note'>
	The current release of the Maqetta application does not provide a quick and easy way
	to transfer or copy files from one project to another. One possible strategy
	to transfer files is to 
</div>


<a id='OrionNavigator'></a>
<h2>Orion Navigator</h2>

<p>Maqetta embeds a version of <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/orion/'>Eclipse Orion</a>,
	which is an open source platform for cloud-based web development. With Orion,
	you can edit source files stored in cloud workspaces directly in the browser.
	Maqetta includes Orion inside so that Maqetta users can take advantage of Orion's
	various features, including its source editor technology that runs in the browser.</p>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	In Maqetta, make sure all files are closed.
	For each of the open files, click on the file tab's close button -
	<img src='img/close_sel.gif' class='exact_size_inline_icon'/>
	- to close all of the editors. </div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Go to the <strong>Open</strong> menu 
	<img src="img/Open_button.png"  class='exact_size_inline_icon'/> 
	at the top of the application.
	Choose the command <strong>Open -&gt; Orion Navigator</strong>.
	A new browser tab/window will open that is running Eclipse Orion,
	with the Orion navigator user interface open showing the contents of
	your personal cloud workspace.
</div>

<div class='overview_snapshots_outer'>
	<span class='overview_snapshots_inner'>
		<img src="img/Orion_Navigator.png" style='height:300px; width:auto;'/> 
	</span>
</div>

<p>In the Orion navigator, at the top level, you will see all of your projects.
	In the picture above, there is only one project ("project1").</p>
	
<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Click on the small right-pointing arrow just to the left of "project1"
	to open up that folder. You should see nearly the same list of HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
	and folders as the Maqetta <strong>Files</strong> palette.
</div>
	
<div class='overview_snapshots_outer'>
	<span class='overview_snapshots_inner'>
		<img src="img/Orion_Navigator_Project_Open.png" style='height:170px; width:auto;'/> 
	</span>
</div>

<div class='note'>
	The Orion Navigator will not show all of the same files as you see in the Maqetta workspace.
	This is because that Maqetta injects some files and folders into user workspaces 
	that are read-only, 
	such as the <code>samples</code> folders. Read-only files and folders do not appear
	in the Orion Navigator.
</div>
	
<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Click on <code>file1.html</code> 
	(assuming it is in your workspace due to previous steps in this tutorial).
	Orion will now switch to its source editor and show the HTML contents of file1.html.
	Find the line of source code that has "Tab 1" on it.
</div>

<pre>
&lt;div data-dojo-type="dijit.layout.ContentPane" title="Tab 1" extractContent="false" preventCache="false" preload="false" refreshOnShow="false" selected="true" closable="false" doLayout="false">&lt;/div>
</pre>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	In the Orion source editor, change the string "Tab 1" to "Reports" (for the <code>title</code> attribute).
	Then click on the <strong>Save</strong> button to save your changes.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Return to the Maqetta browser window. In the <strong>Files</strong> palette,
	double-click on <code>file1.html</code>. On the visual editor canvas, you should
	see that the first tab now says "Reports" instead of "Tab 1".
</div>

<div class='overview_snapshots_outer'>
	<span class='overview_snapshots_inner'>
		<img src="img/Tab_1_to_Reports.png" style='height:220px; width:auto;'/> 
	</span>
</div>

<div class='note'>
	NOTE: Be very careful with source code changes. If you modify HTML, CSS or JavaScript files
	using source editors, and the revised code is not valid HTML, CSS or JavaScript,
	Maqetta might not be able to open your files.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Return to the Orion window. At the top/left, click on the hyperlink for "project1"
	to return to the file navigator. You should once again see the list of files
	in "project1", such as app.css, app.js and file1.html.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	In the Orion window, click on the "New folder" button. In the type-in box,
	enter "img". After completing the operation, you should see a new "img" folder in your project.
	Go back to the Maqetta window. Hit browser refresh, which will cause Maqetta to restart
	and update the <strong>Files</strong> palette. You should see the "img" folder in the 
	Maqetta <strong>Files</strong> palette.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>
	Return to the Orion window. Click <strong>just to the right</strong> 
	(<em>not directly on</em>) the string "img"
	to select the "img" folder. You should see an orange highlight on the "img" line to 
	show that it is selected.
</div>

<div class='note'>
	In Orion, clicking on a file or folder name will cause Orion to open that file or folder.
	Clicking to the right of a file or folder name will cause Orion to select that file or folder.
</div>

<div class='tutorial_step_div'><span class='tutorial_checkmark'>&#8658;</span>

<div class='note'>
	This dialog provides an alternate way for you to upload files into your Maqetta workspace.
	Orion's upload feature includes various features that Maqetta's upload feature does not, 
	including the ability to upload a ZIP file.
