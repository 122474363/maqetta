<h1>Maqetta 10 Release Notes</h1>

<p>The Maqetta 10 release includes the following updates:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0pt;" type="disc">
	<li><span class='majortopic'>Support for overlay widgets, including Dialog, Menu, Tooltip and TooltipDialog</span> - 
		Maqetta now supports various Dojo "overlay" widgets that pop up dynamically at run-time
		based on user actions. Supported widgets include Dialog, Menu, Tooltip and TooltipDialog.
	</li>
	<li><span class='majortopic'>Source edits are non undo-able</span> -
		If you change HTML source code in the Maqetta source editor
		(either in source view or one of the split views), those changes
		are now undoable. This new feature might be particularly important
		for users who accidentally made source code changes that confuse the
		Maqetta HTML parser, previously resulting in either a blank page or
		a red screen of death (with lost work), but now users can click on the
		Undo button on the toolbar to revert their source code changes.
	</li>
	<li><span class='majortopic'>Source editing improvements for mobile applications</span> -
		We fixed some problems when doing source editing of multi-view mobile applications.
		Previously, sometimes after source changes, the page and type-in cursor would
		jump back to the top of the file.
	</li>
	<li><span class='majortopic'>Can now re-order application states using drag/drop</span> -
		In the Scenes palette, you can now re-order application states by dragging one of the
		existing application states to a new position. Note that the Background state cannot be re-ordered.
		It is locked in the first position.
	</li>
	<li><span class='majortopic'>Updated to Eclipse Orion 1.0</span> -
		Previous versions of Maqetta embedded pre-release versions of Eclipse Orion.
		With Release 10, Maqetta now embeds Orion 1.0.
	</li>
	<li><span class='majortopic'>User actual name</span> -
		In various parts of the UI, Maqetta now shows the user's real name
		(e.g., John Smith) instead of the user's email (johnsmith@example.com).
	</li>
	<li><span class='majortopic'>Small "x" icon added to widget palette filter box</span> -
		There is now a small "x" that appears in the filter box for the widget palette
		whenever there is at least one character typed into the filter box. THe "x" icon
		clears the filter box.
	</li>
</ul>
